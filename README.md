# eclipse-theia-14309 README

A sample VS Code extension designed to verify the behavior of `viewsWelcome` in Eclipse Theia: https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/issues/14309.

This VSIX package contributes to `viewsWelcome`. To see it in action, open the `Empty View` in the `Eclipse Theia #14309` sidebar. You can use the commands `setEnablementContextFoo`, `setEnablementContextBar`, and `unsetEnablementContext` to toggle the enablement of different contributions. Additionally, you can use the commands `setWhenContextA`, `setWhenContextB`, and `unsetWhenContext` to control the visibility of these contributions.
